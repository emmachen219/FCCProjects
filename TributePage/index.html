        <p>"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate
          anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.
           It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any
            analytical relations or truths."</p>

        <p>Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville.
        Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his Difference Engine.
        She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could.
        Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He called her "The Enchantress of Number".</p>
        <p>In 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine.
        Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage's
        lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in
        October 1842. Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English.
        She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part
        of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than
        Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs
        under the initialism AAL.</p>
        <p>Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm
        for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered the first published algorithm
        ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as
        the first computer programmer for this reason. The engine was never completed so her program
        was never tested.</p>
        <p>In 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine
        were republished as an appendix to B.V. Bowden's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing
        Machines. The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a
        description of a computer and software.</p>
